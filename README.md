# brick-game-on-MM-BASIC

A simple brick-breaker made in MMBasic (GW-Basic) using the Maximite ColorMax 2 as hardware. I haven't tried to compile it on other Basic-friendly PCs and I wouldn't expect it to work out of the ColorMax 2, but as a code example of a game made in Basic might help others.
The code is uploaded with educational puposes.
